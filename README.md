# NLPolitici
This is a repository where I keep my works on Social Media Intelligence of 2021. I very much enjoy tracking the popularity of organizations, politicians or people online. Currently, I work on a function that can track the sentiment around the securitization of new forms of energy. 
But, with the elections coming up, it is time to track the popularity of the partyleaders of The Netherlands.
